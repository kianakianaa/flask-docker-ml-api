1. A brief (2–3 sentence) explanation of each component in your setup:
    - app.py: a Python Flask API
    - Dockerfile: to build the app container
    - How containerization improves reproducibility: containerization is about packaging an application along with all its dependencies, configurations, and environment. In this way, the application can run the same way no matter where it is deployed.

2. Q1.2 Report the estimated ATE (τˆ) and its statistical significance
    - Estimated ATE: -9.1057
    - Statistical significance: less then 0.001

3. Q1.3 Briefly explain under what assumptions τˆ can be given a causal interpretation
    - No interference between units (e.g. treatment status of one unit does not affect the potential outcomes of another unit)
    - No simultaneity: the causal ordering between Ti and Yi is pre-determined such that Ti affects Yi but not vice versa.
    - Treatment consistency: all individuals receive the same version of the treatment without variation in its implementation.
